👋 Hi, I’m @bozbal – an MES Engineer and lifelong learner with a passion for problem-solving and innovation! With a background in computer engineering, I'm diving into the world of C# to build games, useful mini-apps, and practical software to make life a little easier for everyone.

💻 I’m continuously expanding my skills in C# and eager to take on new challenges, whether it’s designing interactive experiences or creating tools that streamline everyday tasks. My aim is to combine my engineering expertise with a fresh perspective in programming to create something impactful.

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on small projects that push my skills further and are geared toward practical, real-world solutions. Let’s connect and build something meaningful!

⚡ Fun fact: The first computer bug was an actual insect – a moth that snuck into an early computer’s hardware!
